                    <h3>INCLUSION</h3>
                    <p>It is very important for owners Line and Andrea to create a comfortable environment so everybody
                        feels welcomed and
                        included. This is shown by an equal focus on women- and men's wear and by O-S-V opening a café
                        in
                        store in September
                        2023 so customers can stay as long as they want and grab a coffee to stay or to go. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>JOY</h3>
                    <p>Our intention is to facilitate a joyful space for both our team and our customers. It is
                        essential to us that both parts
                        feel appreciated and benefit from our work.  </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>CIRCULARITY</h3>
                    <p>Creating a circular and conscious work environment. The food we eat, the paint we use, the
                        atmosphere we create together
                        are part of the things we keep sustainable and healthy. O-S-V is short for "og så videre" which
                        translates to "and so
                        on”. It represents our vision of giving old clothes new life and to lessen waste in the world.

                    <h3>TRUST</h3>
                    <p>We carefully curate the store with clothes from private customers. The clothes are well taken
                        care of the whole O-S-V
                        team, and the money is transferred every Monday by our admin. We are so lucky to have loyal
                        customers who buy and sell
                        their clothes in our store, so we aim to make it a smooth and trustworthy experience for all
                        parties. </p>

                    <h3>TEAMWORK</h3>
                    <p>Our green and sustainable values are also the reason for our POP UP on the first Saturday of each
                        month. We have POP UP
                        events in O-S-V in collaboration with various local and sustainable businesses. We find it very
                        important to support the
                        sustainable initiatives around us by sharing our lovely location and space.</p>
